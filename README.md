## Project Requirements 

__Key Steps for Project__

Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1) Pick a dataset.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

__Prepare data:__

Gather necessary data to answer your questions
Handle categorical and missing data
Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.

4) Communicate your business insights:

Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

# Black Friday Data Analysis

This notebook looks into using various Python-based data scinece libaries to discover patterns and answer important questions about Black Friday.
Method:
1. Business understanding
2. Prepare data
3. Evaluation /Analyzing
4. Final Conclusion


__Business Understanding__

Black Friday has become a major retail shopping expectation. Black Friday has routinely been the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States at least since 2005. Importantly, this day represented the point in the year when retailers begin to turn a profit.
We want to know if a store had to prepare for Black Friday this information would be valuable:

- How much does someone typically spend on Black Friday? (Which User in this dataset)
- What are the most popular items bought?
- What age group and gender should be marketed to?
- What occupations have the highest purchase rate?


__Prepare Data__
This data was retreived from kaggle. This dataset gives us an overview of the following categories related to Black Friday that will be used to answers the business related questions.

Website for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/sdolezel/black-friday/notebooks

- Product_ID
- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- City_Category
- Stay_In_Current_City_Years
- Marital_Status
- Product_Category_1
- Product_Category_2

__Evaluation/Analyzing__

Initial evaluaiton will help determine what needs to be cleaned and/or removed from the dataset to accurately answer the business related questions.
- Check for missing values
- Check data types are correct
- Removing unnecessary data

__Analyzing__
- Visualize the data (heatmap, clustermap, histographs etc)
- Make conclusion based on the data


__Final Conclusion__

Concluded everything and make an accurate analysis about Black Friday related to the questions.If a store owner had access to this data analysis what would they do? What would they sell? What age group spends the most money. Apply this knowledge in a practical and realistic way.

__This data anaylsis reveals a few key points a store owner could use for Black Friday__
1: Knowing what users spend the most money.
2: The most popular items being bought from thier store.
3: What age group and gender are buying from their store.
4: The type of customer's jobs that spend money at the store.
