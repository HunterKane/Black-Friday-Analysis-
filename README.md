## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Black Friday data to better understand:

Black Friday is a major retail shopping event that has a great impact on businesses that participate. For many businesses Black Friday helps produces enough sales to overcome lagging months and return a profit. Analyzing the data can reveal the patterns and trends found during Balck Friday. Which in turn can be used to help business owners prepare better for the shopping event.

__We want to know if a store had to prepare for Black Friday this information would be valuable:__

- How much does someone typically spend on Black Friday? (Which User in this dataset)
- What are the most popular items bought?
- What age group and gender should be marketed to?
- What occupations have the highest purchase rate?
